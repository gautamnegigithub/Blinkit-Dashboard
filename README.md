# Blinkit-Dashboard
# Project Title: Blinkit Sales Data Dashboard | Power BI
# Project Objective
The main goal of this project is to build a visually compelling and interactive Power BI dashboard that provides deep insights into the sales data of Blinkit—a popular last-minute grocery delivery app operating in India. This project was created in response to stakeholder needs for data-driven decision-making. By converting raw sales data into rich visuals and actionable insights, the dashboard helps the team monitor performance and strategize effectively.

# Dataset Overview
This project involved analyzing Blinkit’s sales data using structured CSV files, which were cleaned, transformed, and modeled in Power BI. The dataset includes a wide range of key variables covering:

1. Item-level sales data

2. Outlet details

3. Product categories

4. Customer preferences (via ratings and fat content)

# Dashboard Structure
This Power BI dashboard has been carefully designed into two insightful pages:

# PAGE 1: Executive Summary (Home)
A visually stunning summary of overall performance, built for quick, high-level insights and strategic overviews.

Top KPIs Displayed:

Total Sales: $1.20M

Average Sales per Item:  $141

Total Items Sold:  8,523

Average Customer Rating:  3.9 / 5

# Category-Wise Revenue Insights:
Bar charts help visualize revenue contribution from top-selling categories:

Fruits & Vegetables – $0.18M

Snacks – $0.18M

Household Needs – $0.14M

Frozen Foods – $0.12M

Dairy Products – $0.10M

A slicer lets users toggle between COGS, Units Sold, and Profit for deeper analysis.

Sales by Outlet Type:
Bar chart comparison reveals:

Supermarket Type 1 leads with $787.55K in sales.

Followed by Grocery Stores and Type 2 & Type 3 supermarkets.

Location-Based Insights:
Tier 3 cities are driving the most revenue ($472.13K), outperforming Tier 1 & 2. Shows huge potential in non-metro regions.

Sales by Fat Content:
Regular Fat products bring in the highest revenue ($776.23K).
Low Fat options still perform well ($425.36K), highlighting growing health-conscious trends.

Trendline: Sales Over Years (2010–2020):
Sales started at $78K in 2010.
Peaked at $250K in 2020, before a slight drop to $131K.

# PAGE 2: Demographic & Outlet Insights
This page dives deep into customer segments, location performance, and demographic sales behavior.

Sales by Outlet Size:

Large Outlets: $507.90K

Medium: $444.79K

Small: $248.99K

This breakdown supports outlet expansion planning and optimization.

Outlet Tier-wise Sales:
Clear opportunity to scale up in Tier 3 cities due to significant contribution.

Customer Ratings & Preferences:
Average product rating is 3.9/5, indicating decent satisfaction but room for improvement.
Helps identify which items require quality or service improvements.

Real-World Recommendations:

1. Double down on Supermarket Type 1 outlets, which dominate revenue performance.

2. Expand Tier 3 coverage—these cities are clearly high-opportunity zones.

3. Increase focus on high-margin categories like snacks and dairy for profitability.

4. Boost marketing for low-fat/healthier options to tap into health-conscious segments.

5. Investigate dip after 2020 and identify recovery strategies.
